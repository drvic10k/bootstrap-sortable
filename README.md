bootstrap-sortable
==================

adding sorting ability to bootstrap table

In fact, it can be used for any tables.

This project is inspired by HTML Kickstart (http://www.99lime.com/elements/) and its sortable table. I took the css and js part from there and stripped the unnecessary formating related to Kickstart.

Using:

Add references to bootstrap-sortable.css and bootstrap-sortable.js to your page. Add class "sortable" to your bootstrap table.

When you add table rows or whole table from client side, use `$.bootstrapSortable()` function to add sortability to parts/tables that were not present at document.ready
